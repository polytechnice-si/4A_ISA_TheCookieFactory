## Setting up the persistence layer

### Configuring the JPA enhancement step in the build chain

We will rely on the _Java Persistence API_ (JPA) to support relational database mappings. The version bundled in the OpenEJB stack is OpenJPA. JPA will enhance annotated classes to create _persistence-aware_ versions of these classes that will be used instead of the one we wrote. This step must be triggered during the compilation process. To introduce this step in the build chain, we simply ask Maven to do so, in the `pom.xml` file. With the following configuration, it will process all the classes in the `entities` package (see the `includes` tag):

```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.apache.openjpa</groupId>
   <artifactId>openjpa-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>2.4.1</version>
   <configuration>
      <includes>**/entities/*.class</includes>
      <addDefaultConstructor>true</addDefaultConstructor>
      <enforcePropertyRestrictions>true</enforcePropertyRestrictions>
   </configuration>
   <executions>
      <execution>
         <id>enhancer</id>
         <phase>process-classes</phase>
         <goals>
            <goal>enhance</goal>
         </goals>
      </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
```

### Declaring the Persistence Unit

A _Persistence Unit_ (PU) is a logical set of entities that persists together and share common persistence properties. For _CoD_, we have to declare such a persistence Unit that contains the three following classes: _Item_, _Customer_ and _Order_. Enumerations do not need to be declared in the unit, as they will not be persistent _per se_. The unit is defined in a file names `resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`. By declaring the unit as relying on the _Java Transaction API_ (JTA) for transactions, the container will activate mechanisms that automatically support transactions, directly at the container level. This mechanism can obviously be bypassed manually when needed.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence version="2.0" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence 
             http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd">
             
    <persistence-unit name="tcf_persistence_unit" transaction-type="JTA">
        <jta-data-source>TCFDataSource</jta-data-source>
        
        <class>fr.unice.polytech.isa.tcf.entities.Customer</class>
        <class>fr.unice.polytech.isa.tcf.entities.Item</class>
        <class>fr.unice.polytech.isa.tcf.entities.Order</class>
        
        <exclude-unlisted-classes>true</exclude-unlisted-classes>
        <properties>
            <property name="openjpa.jdbc.SynchronizeMappings" value="buildSchema(ForeignKeys=true)"/>
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
    
</persistence>
```

## Declaring the data sources

Data sources are the concrete link between the data model defined at the application level and the physical database system that will store the related entities.

The CoD system needs two data sources: _(i)_ a volatile database to be used for test purposes and _(ii)_ a real one for production purpose. In this course, we will use [HSQLDB](http://hsqldb.org/), as the associated drivers are already included for free in the OpenEJB stack. One can use any JDBC compliant database (_e.g._, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Derby), it is just a matter of configuring the container to load the right driver. We will simulate test and production environment using the following assumption: the test suite will be run against an _in-memory_ database (stored directly inside the RAM), where the production environment will rely on a _file-based_ one.

### Declaring the test data source

As Arquilian is used for testing purpose, it is quite logical that an Arquilian configuration is required for tshis very purpose. In the `arquilian.xml` configuration file, the following properties will configure the database to be used for test purposes. 

  * The `JdbcUrl` we used asks for an _in-memory_ database with the `mem` keyword;
    * The `shutdown=true` option will shutdown the database after the last connection; 
  * The `JtaManaged` option will support transactions at the container level for the driver;
  * the `LogSql` option support the logging of the SQL queries generated by JPA on your behalf.

```xml
<property name="properties">
  my-datasource = new://Resource?type=DataSource
  my-datasource.JdbcUrl = jdbc:hsqldb:mem:TCFDB;shutdown=true
  my-datasource.UserName = sa
  my-datasource.Password =
  my-datasource.JtaManaged = true
  my-datasource.LogSql = true
</property>
```

### Declaring the production data source

From the application server point of view, a data source is simply a kind of available external resources, among others. Such resources are defined in the `WEB-INF/resources.xml` file. 

```xml
<resources>
    <Resource id="production" type="DataSource">
        JdbcDriver  org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
        JdbcUrl     jdbc:hsqldb:file:proddb
        UserName    sa
        Password
        LogSql      true
        JtaManaged  true
    </Resource>
</resources>
```

The syntax is different as it is not loaded using the same mechanism than the one used by Arquilian, but the content is the very same. Excepting from the URL, which here refers to a local resource called `proddb` (actually not a single file but a bunch of related ones). This file will be handled by TomEE at runtime and will survive the termination of the TomEE process. __According to our local setup, the files will be stored in the `target/apache-tomee` directory. Which obviously means that calling `mvn clean` will destroy the database contents.__

### Configuring an IDE to explore the database

Your favorite IDE can be used to access to the contents of the persistent database. It simply needs to configure a _local_ HSQLDB source, with default login (_sa_). But be very careful, the file-based database cannot be accessed by two different applications at the very same time. As a consequence, the database is locked during the execution of the application that consumes it. If you forgot to disconnect your IDE from the file, you'll be able to start the application server but attempting to access to the storage layer will result in a timeout exception. __Use with caution__, and rely on tests instead of attempts. the first one are reproducible and ensure that you are not regressing, while the second ones ... does not worth a lot from a software engineering point of view. 

__If you really want to proceed__, be sure to use the full path to reach your local file. Here is an example of configuration using IntelliJ 16 Ultimate Edition.

## Annotating Classes to create Entities

Now, our technical setup is complete, once and for all. We can focus on the business part, _i.e._, storing cookies, customers and related orders. 

EJB Entities are very like EJB sessions, as they share the EJB philosophy, _i.e._, simple POJO with annotations. Excepting that the annotations here are related to persistences instead of functional concerns. Ad that entities needs a little bit more than simple annotations:

  * An empty constructor
  * A proper `equals` method that relies on business items 
  * a proper `hashCode` method to support objects identification in caches. 

The equals and hashCode methods must relies on so-called _business keys_. It is extremely dangerous (and an hideous abstraction leak) to rely at the application level on elements generated by the database layer: you are losing control on object uniqueness. As a consequence, you must be able to define how two entities are equals from a business point of view (the architectural level), and not a technical one (the database one). 

Let's take an example. You have a customer in your database, named "sebastien", with credit card number "1234567890", no orders, and a primary key identifier "42". A request to create a new customer named "sebastien", with credit card number "1234567890" is received by your system. Obviously, his order set is empty, and no primary key were assigned to this newcomer. Are these two entities equals? From a database point of view: the answer is _no_, their primary key differs. From a business point of view, _i.e._, the very purpose of the system, the answer is _yes_, they represent the very same person. So here is a simple golden rule: "__never ever use a database primary key as part of your business object equality definition__"

### Persisting Items

An Item does not exists by itself: it is part of a given cart, or a given order. As a consequence, it is an `Embeddable` entity. Its associated cookie is based on an enumeration, and thus declared as an `Enumerated` property. For clarity and log purposes, we prefer to use string literals (the cookie's name) instead of ordinals (the cookie's index in the enum) at the persistence level. The quantity cannot be null, so we simply add a validation constraint that will prevent to persist an entity with a null quantity of cookies. The cookie cannot be null too, so we use the same kind of constraints.

```java
@Embeddable
public class Item implements Serializable {

	@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
	@NotNull
	private Cookies cookie;

	@NotNull
	private int quantity;
	
	//...
}
``` 


### Persisting Orders

The previously defined `Order` class relies on plain java UUIDs to identify orders among others. UUIDs are not part of the JPA specification, and cannot be used directly. We go here for the quick and dirty solution, _i.e._, altering our data model to store ids as numbers instead of strings. 

  * The `id` field is the refactored as an int;
  * The `orderStatus` field refers to an enumerated, this is the very same situation than the one encountered before for the cookie stored inside an item;
  * The `customer` attribute refers to another entity, and considering that _(i)_ an order will belong to a single customer and _(ii)_ a customer will hopefully make multiple orders, we annotate this attribute as a `ManyToOne`: _many_ orders related to _one_ single customer;
  * The `items` field is a collection of elements that cannot exists by themselves (as we defined an Item as an embeddable entity). We use the brand new `ElementCollection` annotation (available since JPA 2.0) that implement this intention.

We are still encountering a big issue. The `Order` class will be, like the others, automatically translated by OpenJPA into a SQL entity, _i.e._, a table named `ORDER`. You're not seeing the point? Imagine the query that will select the data associated to a given customer, and order her orders based on their status. Seeing it? Ordering the orders? `ORDER` is a SQL keyword, and thus cannot be used as a regular identifier! We need to adapt the way JPA will map the name, using the `@Table` annotation.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name= "orders")
public class Order implements Serializable {

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	private int id;

	@ManyToOne
	private Customer customer;

	@ElementCollection
	private Set<Item> items;

	@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
	private OrderStatus status;
	
	// ...
}
```

### Persisting Customers

Customers were previously identified by their name. This is not reasonable anymore, so we add a primary key field to ensure better unicity. With respect to the other fields:

  * The `name` cannot be null;
  * The `creditCard` follows a regular pattern that we should verify to avoid storing inconsistent data. The pattern is defined as a regular expression (10 digits, _i.e._, `\\d{10}+` in java words);
  * The `orders` field is actually the counterpart of the `customer` one in the `Order` entity. As a consequence it is defined as a `OneToMany` relationship: _one_ customer is linked to _many_ orders. As the customer is the owner of the orders, it defines the `mappedBy` attribute needed to ensure the bidirectional relationship.

```java
@Entity
public class Customer implements Serializable {

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
	private int id;

	@NotNull
	private String name;

	@NotNull
	@Pattern(regexp = "\\d{10}+", message = "Invalid creditCardNumber")
	private String creditCard;

	@OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer")
	private Set<Order> orders = new HashSet<>();
	
	// ...
}
```  


### Hashcode, Equals & Cyclic references

When writing or when using the generated ones, be careful that your equals and hashcode methods do not introduce cyclic calls (symptom: StackOverflowError). For example, by default the generated hashcode methods for the Customer & Order classes looks like the following:

```java
	// Customer
	public int hashCode() {
		int result = getName() != null ? getName().hashCode() : 0;
		result = 31 * result + (getCreditCard() != null ? getCreditCard().hashCode() : 0);
		result = 31 * result + (getOrders() != null ? getOrders().hashCode() : 0);
		return result;
	}
	
	// Order
	public int hashCode() {
		int result = getCustomer() != null ? getCustomer().hashCode() : 0;
		result = 31 * result + (getItems() != null ? getItems().hashCode() : 0);
		result = 31 * result + (getStatus() != null ? getStatus().hashCode() : 0);
		return result;
	}
```
The previous code obviously triggers an infinite loops (this is the very same situation for the equals method). Be very careful when designing these methods, as the semantics of the operation must remain consistent while avoiding cyclic references. In this case, we simply break the cycle by calling `getCustomer().getName().hashcode()` instead of `getCustomer().hashCode()`.


## Testing the persistence layer

An entity lives in the application container like a session component. The only difference is that we will need an `EntityManager` and a transactional context to access it. Tests are implemented as classical components tests, using Arquilian.

The entity manager will be injected by the container. One simply asks for a `PersistenceContext`, which will be provided by the container. As we are relying on JTA for transactional 'stuff', we can delegate it to the container thanks to the `@Transactional` annotation. It will ensure that a new transaction is created at the beginning of the test, and commited at the end, automatically.

```java
@PersistenceContext
private EntityManager entityManager;

@Test
@Transactional(TransactionMode.COMMIT)
public void testCustomerStorage() throws Exception {
	Customer c = new Customer();			// create an empty customer
	c.setCreditCard("1234567890");		// setting up details
	c.setName("John Doe");
	assertEquals(0,c.getId());				// primary key is the default one, i.e., 0
	entityManager.persist(c);				// making the entity persistent
	int id = c.getId();						
	assertNotEquals(0,id);					// an id was assigned by the persistence layer
	Customer stored = (Customer) entityManager.find(Customer.class, id);
	assertEquals(c, stored);				// The initial customer and the retrieved one are equals
}
```

Sometimes it is necessary to manipulate transactions manually. For example, if a constraint is violated when trying to make an object persistent, the aborted transaction at the container level might hide the real reason. Here is an example where we need to manually _rollback_ a given transaction before re-throwing the internal error. One should remark that transactions are also injected by the container, as it is not a developer's responsibility to take care of the transaction pool.

```java
@Resource
private UserTransaction manual;

@Test(expected = ConstraintViolationException.class)
public void constraintViolation() throws Exception {
	Customer c = new Customer();
	c.setName("Foo Bar");
	c.setCreditCard("1234567890xxxx");
	manual.begin();						// starting the transaction manually
	try {
		entityManager.persist(c);
		manual.commit();					// commiting the transaction: everything went well
	} catch(Exception e) {
		manual.rollback();				// rollbacking the transaction is anything went wrong
		throw e;
	}
}
```

## Querying the persistence layer

The entity manager is responsible for all the interactions between the domain and the persistence layer. It support id-based querying, SQL-based queries and object-based queries. Remember that an entity manager needs a transactional context (manual or container-based) to survive.

### Id-based queries

One cas ask the entity manager to retrieve an instance of a given Entity Class, given a relevant id. It will return a _null_ if nothing is found in the database for the given key.

```java
int id = 42;
Customer c = (Customer) entityManager.find(Customer.class, id);
```

### SQL-based queries

The entity manager can be used to talk directly to the database using SQL. This is possible but discouraged, as it introduce a strong coupling between the business layer and the storage one.

However, it is usual in test suite to wipe the database contents after the execution of a test to clean it up  before the next one. This can be done easily:

```
entityManager.createQuery("DELETE FROM Customer").executeUpdate();
```

### Object-based queries

We consider here the implementation of the `findByName` operation exposed by the `CustomerFinder` interface. 

The idea is to create a query that will return a `Customer` based on given `Criteria`. The root of this `CriteriaQuery` is made _from_ the `Customer` class. We want to _select_ using the previously defined root (_i.e._, _from_ `Customer`) instances `i` _where_ `i.name` matches the name given as argument. We then simply asks the entity manager to execute the query and get a single result. If there is one, it is wrapped inside an Optional, and if their is no result, we return the Empty value.

```java 
@Override
public Optional<Customer> findByName(String name) {
	CriteriaBuilder builder = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
	
	CriteriaQuery<Customer> criteria = builder.createQuery(Customer.class);
	Root<Customer> root =  criteria.from(Customer.class);
	
	criteria.select(root).where(builder.equal(root.get("name"), name));
	TypedQuery<Customer> query = entityManager.createQuery(criteria);
	
	try {
		return Optional.of(query.getSingleResult());
	} catch (NoResultException nre){
		 return Optional.empty();
	}
}
```

__Remark__: one can argue that this is way too complex with respect to a simple `SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE NAME = ?` query. This is very true. But however, in front of complex queries, it is more safe to rely on the generations of engineers who worked on the _java-to-sql_ transformation to optimize the query and the associated data loading to retrieve the results properly.

## Attaching, Detaching and Merging entities

Let's consider tests built using a given customer, _John_. John must be the very same one for each tests, as the test framework does not ensure any execution order inside a test suite. To handle this issue, the easiest way is _(i)_ to declare John as a private instance of the test suite, _(ii)_ initialize him using an `@Before` method and finally _(iii)_ destroy him using an `@After` method.

For the `@Before` method, one can simply rely on the registry to create a persistent version of John, and to the associated finder to retrieve it from the persistence layer. But as there is no way to delete a customer using the business operations, we need to use directly the entity manager to achieve this task. First, we use the finder to retrieve the persistent john from the database (in case of volatile changes made by the test we are cleaning up for). This version of John is _detached_, as it was retrieved in another transaction than ours: it was actually retrieved inside the boundary of the `Finder`. Returning the result make the object crossing the boundary of the component, and as a consequence detached it from its initial transaction. We need to _attach_ it to our local persistence context before being allowed to remove it definitively: one cannot remove something that is not synchronized with the persistence layer, it might trigger consistency issues. Thus, we _refresh_ it, obtaining as a result an _attached_ version of John. This version can be safely removed using the entity manager. 

```java
private static final String NAME = "John";
private Customer john;

@Before
public void setUpContext() throws Exception {
	registry.register(NAME, "1234567890");
	john = finder.findByName(NAME).get();
}

@After
// cannot be annotated with @Transactional, as it is not a test method
public void cleaningUp() throws Exception {
	transaction.begin();
		Customer customer = finder.findByName(NAME).get();
	   	entityManager.refresh(customer);
		entityManager.remove(customer);
		john = null;
	transaction.commit();
}
```	

## Cascading Operation through Relations

There is a containment relationship between Customers and Orders. As a consequence, deleting a Customer should delete the associated Orders transitively. If not, one can put the system into an inconsistent state by keeping Orders that are not related to a customer that exists. We consider here a customer `john` that contains a given `order`. The following specification must hold:

```java
assertNotNull(entityManager.find(Customer.class, john.getId()));
assertNotNull(entityManager.find(Order.class, order.getId()));

entityManager.remove(john);

assertNull(entityManager.find(Customer.class, john.getId()));
assertNull(entityManager.find(Order.class, order.getId()));
```

To asks JPA to transitively apply an operation through a given relation, we will rely on the _cascading_ mechanism: the `remove` operation must be cascaded from Customer to Order. We simply have to declare it at the relation level:

```java
public class Customer {

	// ...
	
	@OneToMany(cascade = {CascadeType.REMOVE}, mappedBy = "customer")
	private Set<Order> orders = new HashSet<>();
	
	// ...
}
```

__Warning__: be very careful when cascading operations, especially the `REMOVE` one. Deleting an Order should not delete the associated customer... 

## Removing contained elements

The cascading relationship is used to propagate a persistence operation through relations. It does not automatically support the update of an object. If one wants to remove an order from a given customer, the order must be _removed_ from the persistence layer, and also from the customer:

```java
@Test
@Transactional(TransactionMode.COMMIT)
public void removingOrderInCustomer() throws Exception {
	Customer john = new Customer("John Doe", "1234567890");
	entityManager.persist(john);
	
	Order o1 = new Order(john);
	o1.setStatus(OrderStatus.IN_PROGRESS);
	o1.addItem(new Item(Cookies.CHOCOLALALA, 3));
	entityManager.persist(o1);
	john.add(o1);

	Order o2 = new Order(john);
	o2.setStatus(OrderStatus.IN_PROGRESS);
	o2.addItem(new Item(Cookies.DARK_TEMPTATION, 3));
	entityManager.persist(o2);
	john.add(o2);

	int io1 = o1.getId();
	john.getOrders().remove(o1);
	entityManager.remove(o1);

	assertNull(entityManager.find(Order.class, io1));
	assertNotNull(entityManager.find(Order.class, o2.getId()));
	assertEquals(1, john.getOrders().size());
	assertEquals(o2, john.getOrders().toArray()[0]);
	assertEquals(john, entityManager.find(Customer.class, john.getId()));
}
```

## Lazy-loading

When multiple relations are involved for a given persistent class, it might does not have any sense to load all the contents of the object if not necessary: large database query, big object, ... One can annotate a relation as _lazy_, and then the related element will only be loaded if accessed. For example, to _lazy load_ the orders associated to a given customer:

```java
@OneToMany(cascade = {CascadeType.REMOVE}, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = "customer")
private Set<Order> orders = new HashSet<>();
```

Be careful, the laziness of a relationship is only automated within a given transaction. For example, in the following code, the first time we load the persistent entity we are in a given transaction, meaning that the system can access automatically to the orders, when needed. The second time, we are not in a transaction, and as a consequence the orders are null. 

```java
private Customer loadCustomer(int id) {
	return entityManager.find(Customer.class, id);
}

@Test
public void lazyloadingDemo() throws Exception {
	manual.begin();
		Customer john = new Customer("John Doe", "1234567890");
		entityManager.persist(john);
		Order o1 = new Order(john, Cookies.CHOCOLALALA, 3); entityManager.persist(o1); john.add(o1);
		Order o2 = new Order(john, Cookies.DARK_TEMPTATION, 1); entityManager.persist(o2); john.add(o2);
		Order o3 = new Order(john, Cookies.SOO_CHOCOLATE, 2); entityManager.persist(o3); john.add(o3);
		Customer sameTransaction = loadCustomer(john.getId()) ;
		assertEquals(john, sameTransaction);
		assertEquals(3, john.getOrders().size());
	manual.commit();

	Customer detached = loadCustomer(john.getId()) ;
	assertNotEquals(john, detached);
	assertNull(detached.getOrders());
}
```

__Remark__: Within EJB sessions, a transaction is created each time a method is called. Objects are detached (cutting lazy-loading capabilities to _null_) each time a persistent object crosses the boundary of a transaction.
